# Introduction
This project was done using the Cadence programming language for the flow blockchain technology . This project was required for the metacrafter's course . The purpose of this project is to know how smart contract's are deployed in cadence . We have used the flow's playground (https://play.flow.com). 

# Description

We were required to do few steps to complete this project . 
* Deploy a new contract that has a Struct .
* Created a dictionary or array that contains the Struct defined previously.
* Created a function to add to that array/dictionary
* Added a transaction to call that function in step 3.
* Added a script to read the Struct you defined. 

# Getting started 
To run the code provided , you need to use the flow blockhain's playground and copy paste the code in the same folder's given already . 
In the contracts after pasting the code above you need to click on the deploy option . make sure the code has no error's .
Go to the transactions and copy paste the code given and fill all the information and click 'send'.
Go to the scripts and copy paste the code given and enter the 'year' and click execute .
